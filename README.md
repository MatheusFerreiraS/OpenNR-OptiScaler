# OpenNR OptiScaler

An [OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler) fork for AMD Radeon cards, part of the OpenNR project. Games
that ask for DLSS get NVIDIA's DLSS 5 neural rendering (NR) networks and DLSS Ray Reconstruction, run on AMD hardware
by open and community runtimes. Everything else OptiScaler does (FSR, XeSS, frame generation, spoofing) is still here.

This README covers what the fork adds. For OptiScaler itself, see the
[upstream project](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler) and its wiki.

## Supported GPUs

| Feature | Radeon cards |
|---|---|
| NR, danielblnc 0.6.0 (HIP) | RX 6000, RX 7000, RX 9000 with HIP 7 (RX 6000 needs AMD's HIP SDK 7.2) |
| NR, danielblnc 0.8.0 (NeuralHub host) | RX 7000, RX 9000 |
| NR, lmxxf 0.45 | RX 9070 and RX 9060 series |
| NR, mochizuki 0.0.8.2 (Vulkan) | RX 9000; RX 7000 and RDNA3 APUs on an experimental network |
| Ray Reconstruction, OpenRR 0.1.0 | RX 9000, D3D12 and Vulkan games |
| Ray Reconstruction, FSR-RR (AMD Ray Regeneration) | RX 9000 |

## Install

The easy way is the [OpenNR Installer](https://github.com/zmodelerlover/OpenNR-Installer/releases). It finds your
games, downloads this fork, the runtimes and their weights, and can take it all back out.

By hand:

1. Extract the release next to the game's executable (for Cyberpunk 2077, `bin\x64`).
2. Put the runtime files you want next to `Setup.bat`: danielblnc's `version.dll` or `dlssnr_on_amd_setup.exe` (and
   `dlssnr_on_amd_weights.bin` if you have it), or lmxxf's `native-game-tiled-assets\`. mochizuki and OpenRR are set
   up by the installer.
3. Close the game, run `Setup.bat`, pick the game folder and a proxy name (`dxgi.dll` is the usual one).
   `Uninstall_OptiScaler_NR.bat` in the game folder removes it.
4. In game, press **Insert**, open the **Neural** tab and turn on **Enable NR**. Pick the runtime under
   **NR runtime** (applies on the next launch).

No runtime's weights ship in this repository or its releases. They come from NVIDIA's models and are made on your PC
or downloaded by the installer.

## Features

- **Three NR runtimes**, picked per game with `NrBackend` in `[DlssNr]`: danielblnc's
  [DLSS-NR-on-AMD](https://github.com/danielblnc/DLSS-NR-on-AMD) (0.6.0 on HIP, or 0.8.0 as NeuralHub's host, which
  also brings its DLSS-SR, DLSS-RR and DLSS-FG to AMD), [lmxxf's HIP port](https://github.com/lmxxf/dlss5-on-amd-9070xt-porting)
  and [mochizuki0323's Vulkan port](https://gitlab.com/mochizuki0323/DLSSNR-AMD).
- **NR before upscaling, or on the final image** in games without an upscaler (D3D9, D3D11, D3D12, Vulkan, OpenGL).
- **OpenRR**: our own DLSS Ray Reconstruction runtime (MIT), built from the game's `nvngx_dlssd.dll` 310.9.1. When it
  can't run, Ray Reconstruction falls back to FSR-RR. Settings in `[OpenNR-RR]`.
- **FSR SDK 2.4**: FSR 4.1.2 upscaling, frame generation 4.0.2 and Ray Regeneration 1.2.1 as FSR-RR
  (`Dx12Upscaler=fsr-rr`).
- **XeSS multi frame generation** up to 8X on AMD cards (`FGOutput=xefg`).
- **RenoDX colour composition** after the runtime (`RenoComposition`, off by default) and **person protection**
  (`NrPersonPartition`, off by default).
- **32-bit games**: D3D9, D3D10, D3D11 and OpenGL through the proxies in `x86\` and a 64-bit host
  ([tools/dx9-x86/README.md](tools/dx9-x86/README.md)).
- An NR toggle key (Numpad 5), a neural pass timer on the FPS overlay, an optional "NR ON" badge, and a screenshot key
  (F6) that saves the frame with NR applied.

Every key is documented in `OptiScaler.ini`, next to its default. On NVIDIA cards the fork can drive NVIDIA's own
DLSS-NR instead; see [INSTALL-DLSSNR.md](INSTALL-DLSSNR.md).

## Building

Visual Studio with the v143 toolset, `Release|x64`, after `git submodule update --init`. Keep `tools\` beside the
solution, a pre-build step runs from it.

- `tools\build-lmxxf-runtime.cmd exports\lmxxf-runtime` builds the lmxxf runtime.
- `tools\build-mochizuki-runtime.cmd exports\mochizuki-runtime` builds the mochizuki runtime (MSVC prompt, Vulkan SDK
  1.4.357 or newer, Python).
- `tools\build-person-worker.cmd` builds the person protection worker.
- `tools\PACKAGE_RELEASE.ps1` makes the release zip.

OpenRR is built from its own repository. CI checks formatting with clang-format 20 under `OptiScaler/`.
