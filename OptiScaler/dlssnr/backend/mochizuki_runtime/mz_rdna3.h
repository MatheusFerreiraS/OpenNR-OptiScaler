// The checks the RDNA3 network (RX 7000, FP16 matrices) passes before it runs on a device (MochizukiNrRuntime.cpp).
//
// Layout: its kernels assume the gfx11 fragment layout mauri870's fork measured on RADV (an accumulator component c
// of lane l is element (2c + l/16, l%16), an A or B fragment holds 16 components a lane, row m of a product comes from
// lane half m%2 alone, and swapping every k pair in the upper half changes no product). AMD's Windows compiler may
// order the components otherwise; the network then runs and draws a wrong picture. LayoutCheck runs the probes of the
// RX 7000 kit (rdna3_probe/, embedded) on the network's own device, at the session's start.
//
// Pipelines: AMD's compiler (LLPC) has crashed on some of the network's shaders. PipelineCheck compiles every one of
// them in a child process (rundll32 on this DLL's MochizukiNrPipelineCheck entry), before the first network build on a
// driver, on the builder thread, so a crash or a hang ends only the child.
//
// Both verdicts are kept in dlssnr-amd\rdna3-check.txt by device id and driver version, the pipelines' also by
// the shader files (Cached, Keep), so each runs once a driver.
